= Frequently Asked Questions

== Is `cider-nrepl` specific to CIDER?

No, the name is a bit of a misnomer. All of the functionality in
`cider-nrepl` can be leveraged by any nREPL client. Many Clojure editors
are built on top of `cider-nrepl`.

If we were naming the project today we would have gone with `orchard-nrepl`. Naming is hard!

== Does `cider-nrepl` support ClojureScript?

Yes, it does. The support, however, is partial and not all of the functionality if available
for ClojureScript.

== Does `cider-nrepl` support ClojureCLR?

No, it does not.

== Are there any other nREPL middleware libraries similar to `cider-nrepl`?

Yeah, there are. Most notably there's `refactor-nrepl` which provides a lot of
refactoring functionality for Clojure editors.
